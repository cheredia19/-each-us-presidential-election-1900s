## 1972 | Richard Nixon (R) v. George McGovern (D)

The 1972 election was held on November 7. The Democratic Party's nomination was eventually won by Senator **George McGovern**, who ran an anti-war campaign against the Republican candidate for reelection **Richard Nixon** but was handicapped by his outsider status and the [firing of his running mate Thomas Eagleton](https://www.npr.org/2012/08/04/157670201/the-thomas-eagleton-affair-haunts-candidates-today).

Shielded by a good economy and his successes in foreign affairs (especially ending American involvement in Vietnam and establishing relations with China), Nixon easily won the election with a difference of 23.2 percentage points (almost 18 million ballots) in the popular vote, the widest margin of any U.S. presidential election. The incumbent collected the electoral votes in all states except Massachusetts (14) and the District of Columbia (3).

## 1976 | Jimmy Carter (D) v. Gerald Ford (R)

The 1976 United States presidential election was held in the aftermath of [Watergate](https://www.britannica.com/event/Watergate-Scandal), one of the biggest political scandals in the country's history. 

It pitted incumbent President **Gerald Ford**, the Republican candidate who assumed office after the resignation of Nixon, against former governor of Georgia, **Jimmy Carter**, the Democratic nominee. 

Ford was saddled with a slow economy and paid a political price for his [pardon of Nixon](https://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/nixon-pardon). Carter ran as a Washington outsider and reformer and won a narrow victory.

**Ford won Washington. However one elector cast a vote for Ronald Reagan*

## 1980 | Ronald Reagan (R) v. Jimmy Carter (D)

The domestic policies implemented by President **Jimmy Carter** failed to resonate with the American public. Also, his image as an international leader was damaged by the [Iranian hostage crisis](https://history.state.gov/departmenthistory/short-history/iraniancrises) that began on November 4, 1979, and lasted 444 days.

Nevertheless, the Democrats were not inclined to switch allegiance from an incumbent, so Carter had no difficulty securing his party nomination. On the Republican side, **Ronald Reagan** was successful in the primaries, securing the nomination.

When the campaign began, Carter held a lead over Reagan. However, the GOP candidate changed the voters' perception to the point that claimed a comfortable victory, initiating **twelve years of Republican control of the White House** until Bill Clinton took office in 1992. The 1980 election marked the beginning of what is popularly called the [*Reagan Revolution*](https://pressbooks-dev.oer.hawaii.edu/ushistory/chapter/the-reagan-revolution/).

## 1984 | Ronald Reagan (R) v. Walter F. Mondale (D)

The 1984 United States presidential election was a contest between the incumbent President, **Ronald Reagan**, and Democratic former Vice President **Walter Mondale**. 

The GOP nominee was helped by some policies: a strong recovery from the [recession of 1981â€“82](https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/recession-of-1981-82), his increase in defense spending, and aggressive anti-communism stances. At the same time, his advocacy of tax cuts was well-received even though federal deficits had risen, contrary to some of the predominant economic premises.

Reagan carried 49 of the 50 states, becoming **the second presidential candidate to achieve the feat** after Richard Nixon's victory in 1972. Mondale's only electoral votes came from the District of Columbia, which has always been considered a Democratic guarantee, and his home state of Minnesota, which he won by a mere 3761 votes.

Reagan's 525 electoral votes (out of 538) are **the highest total ever received by a presidential candidate**, while Mondale's 13 electoral votes is also the 2nd-fewest ever received by a second-place candidate, second only to Alf Landon's 8 in 1936. In the national popular vote, Reagan received 58.8% to Mondale's 40.6%.

## 1988 | George Bush (R) v. Michael S. Dukakis (D)

Ronald Reagan, the incumbent President, was vacating the position after serving the maximum two terms allowed by the [Twenty-second Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-22/). Consequently, the 1988 United States presidential election featured Reagan's Vice President, **George H. W. Bush** and Democratic nominee **Michael S. Dukakis**.

A good economy, a stable international stage (the U.S. was not involved in any wars or conflicts during this time), and Reagan's popularity allowed the Republican ticket to claim an easy victory. Dukakis carried only ten states (and the District of Columbia) but still had a positive result for the Democratic party compared with the outcome four years earlier. 

Bush became the first incumbent Vice President of the United States to win a presidential election in 152 years since Martin Van Buren in 1836. Just like Van Buren in 1840, Bush would be defeated for reelection in 1992 after serving a single term.

## 1992 | Bill Clinton (D) v. George Bush (R)

The United States presidential election of 1992 marked the effort by the Republican Party to extend their 12-year hold on the White House, while the Democrats, led by **Bill Clinton**, aimed to bring their image more towards the center. An independent push by billionaire H. Ross Perot of Texas tried to focus the debate on the national debt.

Incumbent **George Bush** alienated much of his conservative base by breaking his 1988 campaign pledge against raising taxes. His perceived greatest strength, foreign policy, was less influential following the [collapse of the Soviet Union](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1989-1992/collapse-soviet-union) and the relatively peaceful climate in the Middle East after the defeat of Iraq in the [Gulf War](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1989-1992/gulf-war).

On the election day, Clinton easily outdistanced Bush in the Electoral College. Perot managed 18.9% of the popular balloting but earned no electoral votes.

## 1996 | Bill Clinton (D) v. Bob Dole (R)

In the election of 1996, the Democrats were backed by a good economy and stable international affairs, as well as the momentum of an incumbency in the White House. The Republicans tried to provide a solid reason for the electorate to change but were unsuccessful. 

There was no significant opposition to the renomination of President **Bill  Clinton** and Vice President Al Gore by the 1996 Democratic convention delegates, who met in Chicago between August 26-29.  

On the GOP side, Senator **Bob Dole** of Kansas benefited from a strong early performance in the primaries. 

On election day, November 5, Clinton and Gore comfortably won the popular and electoral college contests. The latter was not much different from 1992.
